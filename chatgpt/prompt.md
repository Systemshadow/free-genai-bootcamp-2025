### **Step 1: Vocabulary Breakdown**  

Let's begin by identifying the key words in the sentence and their French equivalents.  

| **English**         | **French**       | **Grammatical Notes**                            |
|---------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| The man            | L'homme          | *"Lâ€™"* is used before vowels or silent "h".    |
| At the store       | Au magasin       | *"Au"* = "Ã " (to/at) + "le" (the).             |
| Offered           | A offert         | *PassÃ© composÃ©* of "offrir" (to offer).        |
| Me                | Mâ€™ / Moi          | *"Mâ€™"* before a vowel, *"Moi"* for emphasis.   |
| An apple          | Une pomme        | "Une" (feminine article) for "pomme".          |

### **Step 2: Key Grammar Rules**  

1. **Definite vs. Indefinite Articles**  
   - "The man" â†’ *L'homme* (definite, because we are referring to a specific man).  
   - "An apple" â†’ *Une pomme* (indefinite, because itâ€™s one of many apples).  

2. **Prepositions of Place**  
   - "At the store" â†’ *Au magasin* (*Ã  + le* contracts to *au*).  

3. **Past Tense (PassÃ© ComposÃ©)**  
   - "Offered" â†’ *A offert* (helping verb *avoir* + past participle *offert*).  

4. **Pronoun Placement**  
   - "Me" â†’ *Mâ€™* (before the verb when conjugated).
