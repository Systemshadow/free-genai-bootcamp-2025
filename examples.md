### **Step 2: Key Grammar Rules**  

1. **Definite vs. Indefinite Articles**  
   - "The man" â†’ *L'homme* (definite, because we are referring to a specific man).  
   - "An apple" â†’ *Une pomme* (indefinite, because itâ€™s one of many apples).  

2. **Prepositions of Place**  
   - "At the store" â†’ *Au magasin* (*Ã  + le* contracts to *au*).  

3. **Past Tense (PassÃ© ComposÃ©)**  
   - "Offered" â†’ *A offert* (helping verb *avoir* + past participle *offert*).  

4. **Pronoun Placement**  
   - "Me" â†’ *Mâ€™* (before the verb when conjugated).
